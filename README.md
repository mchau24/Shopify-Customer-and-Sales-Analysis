# Shopify-Customer-and-Sales-Analysis

## 1. Business Requirement
This project aims to analyse Shopify sales data using Power BI to uncover meaningful insights into transaction trends, customer buying behaviour, and long-term customer value. Through an interactive dashboard, the goal is to equip stakeholders with a clear view of revenue drivers, retention rates, and engagement trends to support data-driven decision-making.

## 2. KPIs
**2.1 Transactions Performance**
- Focuses on evaluating the overall health and effectiveness of sales operations by tracking:
    - Net sales: total revenue before tax.
    - Total quantity: total number of products sold.
    - Net average order value: the average revenue per transaction, excluding tax.

**2.2 Customer Purchase Behaviour**
- Understanding of how customers interact with the business. This section highlights:
    - Total customers: count of unique buyers.
    - Single order customers: count of customers who placed only one order.
    - Repeat customers: count of customers with more than one order, indicating loyalty.

**2.3 Retention and Value KPIs**

    - Lifetime value (LTV): total revenue generated by a customer over time.
    - Repeat rate: percentage of customers who return to make another purchase.
    - Purchase frequency: how many times customers place orders, on average.
